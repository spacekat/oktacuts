## Background

I wrote this extension after finding myself typing `m/` for Gmail, `c` for Calendar, etc., thanks to a previous employer setting things up that way.

This is a simple app that I may push along depending on interest, that lets you create these shortcuts **with** the added benefit of easy synchronization with an Okta instance!
